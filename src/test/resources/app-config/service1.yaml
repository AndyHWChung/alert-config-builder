  # Endpoint that provides a basic health check for the app
  # healthy = HTTP 200 response with some data
  #
  healthcheck:
    endpoint: /ping/ping

  #
  # number of instances (containers) of the microservice to start
  # This should be N+1, where ideally N is determined by performance tests
  #
  instances: 2

  #
  # Slots - memory allowance for a container
  # 1 slot = 128MB of ram

  slots: 4

  #
  # extra environment variables passed to the container
  # We use that mostly for microservices that are not java based, but it
  # can be used for java apps as well

  #environment:

  #
  # Xms and Xms settings - should be 50% less than slots
